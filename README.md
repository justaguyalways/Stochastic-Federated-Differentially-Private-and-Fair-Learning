# Federated_Private_and_Fair_Learning
  
Code for our paper titled "A Stochastic Optimization Framework for Private and Fair Learning From Decentralized Data"

For tuning our hyperparameters, please use the args_fed.py file to accordingly set the dataset, federated setting parameters, privacy parameters, lambda list, and other hyperparameters. Then, run our code using the command

```python
python dp_fermi_federated.py
