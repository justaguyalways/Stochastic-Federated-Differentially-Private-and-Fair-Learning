Code for our paper titled "A Stochastic Optimization Framework for Private and Fair Learning From Decentralized Data"

Paper Link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07889](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07889)

For tuning our hyperparameters, please use the args_fed.py file to accordingly set the dataset, federated setting parameters, privacy parameters, lambda list, and other hyperparameters. Then, run our code using the command

```python
python dp_fermi_federated.py
```
